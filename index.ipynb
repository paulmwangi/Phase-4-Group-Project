The NAR provides home sales and price data, while the US Census Bureau provides population data, and the BEA provides GDP data. Analysis was done on the trend of home prices in Washington from 2002 to 2018 using the Zillow dataset and compared it to the trend in the NAR dataset. \n",

Additionally, analysis on the trend of population and GDP growth was done using the US Census Bureau and BEA data, respectively, to examine their impact on the real estate market in Washington and compared them to Zillow's data. \n",

The findings can be used to make informed decisions and provide recommendations for the real estate industry in Washington, while keeping in mind the limitations of the data analysis and the need for further research to gain a complete picture of the real estate market in the US.
